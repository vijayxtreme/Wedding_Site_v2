      <div class="story-story">The two of us met February 17th, 2015, through an online matchmaking service, both initially unsure of the modern day arranged marriage process, but as we bonded over our love for trying new foods, exploring the sights and sounds of the Los Angeles/OC area, and Hindi films, we quickly found ourselves looking forward to what each of us would teach the other. We’re looking forward to sharing our lives together after our marriage in July, and we’d love to have you there to mark the celebration.</div>
