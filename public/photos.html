      <p>The two of us started talking February 16th, 2015, through email after seeing each other’s profile on an online matchmaking site. We exchanged a few phone calls and were excited to find someone else who was adventurous in food tastes and decided to meet at a restaurant in Seal Beach. We spent the next 5 hours talking and made a follow-up date where we spent another 7 hours learning about each other’s world views and dreams. Our values were fundamentally aligned, but our personalities were different in a way that intrigued us – Priya, with her sense of ambition and practicality, and Naveen, with his sense of idealism and dreaminess.</p> 
      <p>We had fun sharing our interests and discovering new ones together, while we explored the sights, sounds, and flavors of LA/OC. As we began to look forward to meeting more often and teaching/learning from each other, our worlds continued to expand, doubling our friends, families, hopes, and joys. We can’t wait to share all of our excitement for our future together with all of the special people in our lives, and we want to extend the warmest invitation to celebrate with us in July.</p>
